        <h1>A Fairy Tale</h1>
        <section class="about">
            <p class="par1">Once upon a time, in a land far away, nestled within the lush green valleys and towering mountains, there existed a magical kingdom named Lumina. Lumina was renowned for its shimmering glow and enchanting aura, and it was ruled by a wise and just queen named Seraphina.</p>

            <p class="par2">In this kingdom, fairies roamed freely, spreading joy and granting wishes to all who believed in their magic. The most extraordinary among them was a young and spirited fairy named Luna. Luna possessed a rare giftâ€”the ability to communicate with animals.</p>

            <p class="par3">One day, while venturing deep into the heart of the enchanted forest, Luna stumbled upon an injured unicorn named Stardust. With a gentle touch and a sprinkle of fairy dust, Luna healed Stardust's wounded leg. Grateful and touched by Luna's kindness, Stardust pledged a lifelong bond of friendship.
